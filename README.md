This is the writeup repo of PicoCTF 2021 for the high schooler Only Feet CTF team. Skuzi, Pyrus, M0RG4N4, and aHaquer.

In the end we came in 737th place globally (15th page) and **137th place for US middle and highschool** (3rd page), not bad considering that we didn't work on the challenge at all past the first week.
